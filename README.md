# Image Processing: Kernel Convolution

# Work still in progress



## Kernel convolution
The idea behind image processing with kernel convolution is to use a special matricial operation called _convolution_ which takes as input two matrices: a matrix of weights, which is the kernel, and the matrix of the RGB values of our image (in the range [0, 255]).  
For instance, if we use a 3x3 kernel matrix and for simplicity a 3x3 pixel image, the central pixel of the modfiied image will be evaluated as

For edge and corner pixels, the idea is to locally overextend the image using the available pixels. Visit the

[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))
on the subject for more information.
