# Image Processing: Kernel Convolution

# Work still in progress



## Kernel convolution
The idea behind image processing with kernel convolution is to use a special matricial operation called _convolution_ which takes as input two matrices: a matrix of weights, which is the kernel, and the matrix of the RGB values of our image (in the range [0, 255]).  
For instance, supposing we use a 3x3 kernel matrix, the pixel RGB value at position [2,2] in the modified image will be calculates as

For edge and corner pixels, the idea is to locally overextend the image using the available pixels, that is we calculate
